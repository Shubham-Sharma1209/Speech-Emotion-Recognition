# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
This is Machine Learning based project developed for the Mini Project submission for my Bachelor of Technolgy in 2nd year.
A research paper was return on this Project and Topic which was accepted and presented in ICCSAI,2022 conferenece.
# Objective
The main objective of this project waws to create a ML model that can recognise emotion from a human voice and classify speaker's emotions. This model was prepared to only recognise main 6 emotions of a human being which are Anger, Sad, Happy, Fear, Disgust and Neutral(Calm). Different models were trained and compared to choose the model which has the highest score from different evaluations. Differnet models used are Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, MLP CLasifier, Decision Trees Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Extra Trees Classifier.
